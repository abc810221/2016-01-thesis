## SASS

If you want to compile sass, you have two options. You can can run `gulp sass` or `npm run sass`. Either will compile correctly. Alternatively, you can run `gulp sass:watch` to constantly watch for changes you make and compile as you go.

## Linting

In order to lint all files in the client directory, you can run either `gulp lint` or `npm lint`. Either will lint correctly. Later, we will add linting to the server files.
